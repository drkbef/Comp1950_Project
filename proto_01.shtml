	       <h3>Expectations &amp; Reminders</h3>

           <p>This course is about Web Development. This means you should conduct yourself as Web Developers!</p>
         <p>What does this mean? It means you should understand the following:</p>
         <dl>
          <dt>FTP</dt>
          <dd>
            If you don't understand FTP (File Transfer Protocol) right now, that's ok. After week 2 - don't ask me. This is a
            <strong>required</strong>
            skill
           </dd>
         <dt>File/Folder Names</dt>
           <dd>
           While it is technically possible, my recommendation is that you do NOT use capital letters, and I
            <strong>require</strong>
           that you do NOT use spaces in your file or folder names. Special Characters (those characters over the numbers on your keyboard) just won't work.
           </dd>
          <dt>Web Space</dt>
          <dd>
         The student web space is:
        <strong>students.thenet.ca/(student_name)</strong>
        <br>
          Notice that there is
          <strong>no www</strong>
          at the front
         </dd>
         <dt>Upkeep</dt>
         <dd>Each week, you should have your course web space (we'll set up the course web site later) up to date with assignments, exercises, etc.</dd>
         <dt>Navigation</dt>
         <dd>Please try to make things as easy to find as possible</dd>
         </dl>
