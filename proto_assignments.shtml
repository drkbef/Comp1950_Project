			   <h3>Week 01</h3>
               <p>Create your course web site: </p>
				<ul>
<li>
Check out the example page created by a past student:
<a href="http://past.thenet.ca/lori/">Lori's Example</a>
</li>
<li>
Specifically, what I would like to see:
<ul>
<li>
On your homepage:
<ul>
<li>Include some information about yourself (such as from your introduction today) including a photo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
For week one:
<ul>
<li>A brief overview of your skill level, web development work you have done so far (if any), links to favourite sites</li>
<li>A list of tools, plug-ins, applications or IDEs that you use for web development, including links to web pages of these tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use your understanding of HTML and CSS to the limit of your knowledge, but ensure that it is usable, presentable and coherent</li>
<li>This site will be used for the rest of the course, edited each week</li>
<li>
If we do an exercise in class or if you are assigned something for homework, please make sure you indicate that. Link to exercises and assignments from the appropriate week.
<em>Don't make me have to search for your homework.</em>
</li>
<li>
There needs to be a link from the
<strong>myBCIT Members</strong>
page to your Student Homepage
</li>
</ul>
