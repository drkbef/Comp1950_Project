               <p>Create your course web site: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				Check out the example page created by a past student:
				<a href="http://past.thenet.ca/lori/">Lori's Example</a>
				</li>
				<li>
				Specifically, what I would like to see:
				<ul>
				<li>
				On your homepage:
				<ul>
				<li>Include some information about yourself (such as from your introduction today) including a photo</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
				For week one:
				<ul>
				<li>A brief overview of your skill level, web development work you have done so far (if any), links to favourite sites</li>
				<li>A list of tools, plug-ins, applications or IDEs that you use for web development, including links to web pages of these tools.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Use your understanding of HTML and CSS to the limit of your knowledge, but ensure that it is usable, presentable and coherent</li>
				<li>This site will be used for the rest of the course, edited each week</li>
				<li>
				If we do an exercise in class or if you are assigned something for homework, please make sure you indicate that. Link to exercises and assignments from the appropriate week.
				<em>Don't make me have to search for your homework.</em>
				</li>
				<li>
				There needs to be a link from the
				<strong>myBCIT Members</strong>
				page to your Student Homepage

			  <p><strong>General Instruction</strong>
			  </p><p>Take the content located on the content page, and make it look as close to this example page as possible. </p>

			<p>All of the images are located here:</p>
			<ul>
                <li><a href="#">First Finnegan photo</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Second Finnegan photo</a></li>
				<li class="title">Requirements
				<ul>
                <li>Make sure your page validates as XHTML Strict. Use the W3C Validator, and add link from the page directly to the validator using a referer (do some research on how to do this)</li>
                <li>Use CSS to create the presentation layer, fonts and measurements don't have to be exact. The page should have a strong resemblance</li>
                <li>Use any layout scheme you would like (tables, CSS, etc)</li>
                </ul>
				</li>
              <li class="title">Suggestion
	          
	          	<ul>
                <li>Try to use some of the plugins we looked at today to help you determine how to build the page properly</li>
               	</ul></li>
