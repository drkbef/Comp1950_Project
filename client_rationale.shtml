		<h3>Rationale</h3>
			<p>
			The existing COMP 1950 website is brief, to the point, and gets the job done by providing BCIT students with weekly lecture notes, example, and assignments.  We built further on its design by creating a more user-friendly interface design that focuses on the user experience and interaction, by making lecture notes, examples and other information big and clear. Project team Lament reviewed and revised the existing web site using the practices taught throughout this course. The following below describes the results of this review and the implications for the recommended re-design.

			<h3>The Audience</h3>
			<p>Our target audience is all of BCIT's students, but more specifically, students who are  enrolled in the BCIT COMP 1950- Intermediate Web Development and Design course. This web site will provide an easy access to lecture notes, assignments, and exercises, and be a reference companion to the students as they strive towards their academic and career goals. Alumni students may gain access to review previous materials, while prospective students will have a readily available overview and syllabus of the course deliverables.

			<h3>Site Layout</h3>
			<p>Keeping the web site stylish without the use of a lengthily and useless flash intro, team Lament implemented a color scheme to create a more appealing web experience to students; the soothing browns represent a calming, and scholarly feel.  The team has found that the existing vertical navigation can be effective for visitors to find their way through the site, but felt moving it to the left made it more obvious and accessible for a North American audience.

			<h3>Site Navigation</h3>
			<p>
	        </p>
			<p>To enhance the user experience, we made changes that allow students easier access to various components of each lecture, and we have tweaked the content of the vertical navigation by adding places for exercises, code examples, and other resources.  By including an additional horizontal navigation at the top beneath the main banner, the site now offers a more efficient access to content.

			<h3>Search Box</h3>
			<p>Adding a Search box will save users precious time by finding their topic of interest quickly, rather than manually skimming though lecture sections.  The team has made this tool available at the top navigation to assist visitors in finding their desired material.

			<h3>External links </h3>
			<p>External links that are found frequently visited are made available to student on the side navigation under the subject title “Resources” for easier access. Although weekly lecture notes may often contain external links, team Lament believes that searching in the search box provided in the top navigation would preserve the sites’ elegance and prevent flooding of information that lacks content.

			<h3>Mobile Devices</h3>
			<p>As we progress into the 21st century, web pages are becoming more frequently viewed on cell phones and other small devices. Students may be using their mobile devices to keep them up-to-date with late-breaking news, or with their latest social updates. Therefore, web sites must leverage this growing trend.  Team Lament has responded by incorporating media-queries into the re-designed site, allowing it to be accessible on more platforms.

			<h3>Blog</h3>
			<p>We have incorporated a blog for informative educational use, allowing to keep users up-to-date on the latest news and information regarding their course.  This will also allow the instructor to share other interesting articles, links, and quickly post additional resources.
