<h3>Rationale</h3>

The previous existing COMP 1950 website was brief, but to the point and gets the job done providing BCIT students with weekly lecture notes, example, and assignments. Considering creating a more user-friendly interface design in focus on the user experience and interaction where lecture notes, examples and other information are easily accessed. We have established new grounds on the redesign of the COMP1950 web site.
